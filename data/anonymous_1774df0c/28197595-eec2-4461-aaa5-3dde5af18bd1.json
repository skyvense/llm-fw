If that's the case, there are several methods you can use, such as factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me explain one common method: the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere's how to use it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients**: Look at your equation and identify the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). These are the coefficients of \\( x^2 \\), \\( x \\), and the constant term, respectively.\n\n   For example, if your equation is \\( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \\), then:\n   - \\( a = 2 \\)\n   - \\( b = 3 \\)\n   - \\( c = -5 \\)\n\n2. **Plug the coefficients into the formula**: Substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n\n   So, for the example:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-5)}}{2 \\cdot 2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the discriminant**: The part under the square root is called the discriminant (\\( D \\)).\n\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 4ac\n   \\]\n   For our example:\n   \\[\n   D = 9 - (-40) = 49\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the roots**:\n   \n   - Calculate the numerator for both the plus and minus cases.\n   - Take the square root of the discriminant.\n\n   So, for our example:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{49}}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-3 - \\sqrt{49}}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 + 7}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-3 - 7}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-10}{4} = -2.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Write the solutions**: The roots of the equation are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2.5 \\).\n\nSo, the solutions to \\( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \\) are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2.5 \\). \n\nIf you have a specific equation in mind or need further clarification, feel free to ask!","tokens_in":4,"tokens_out":620,"server":"ollama","timestamp":"2025-03-18T17:59:45.064194+08:00","source":""}
